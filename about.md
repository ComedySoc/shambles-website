<h3><span class="cooper">Comedy</span> scenes made up on the spot</h3>
<h3>Based on suggestions made by <span class="cooper">you</span></h3>

Formed in 2007 at the University of York, The Shambles originated as a short form improvisational comedy troupe called "The Scabs". Over the years, their reputation evolved (as well as their name) and they have become one of the most loved improv troupes at the Edinburgh Fringe.

They perform a range of songs, scenes and games based entirely on your suggestions. Performing throughout the entire Fringe and regularly around York, there's always a chance to catch the fast wit of The Shambles.

Also, they're called The Shambles after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shambles">this famous road in York.</a> Not because they are bad.
